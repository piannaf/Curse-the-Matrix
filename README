Curse The Matrix
Copyright (c) Justin Mancinelli

Obligatory matrix character flow written with ncurses.

The intention of this project is to help me learn C and get used to vim.

HISTORY
	Version 1.0
		Simply uses ncurses to print a random character to the next
		column of the terminal then loops back around when it reaches
		the end.
