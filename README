Curse The Matrix
Copyright (c) Justin Mancinelli

Obligatory matrix character flow written with ncurses.

The intention of this project is to help me learn C and get used to vim.

HISTORY
    Version 3.0
        --Rewrote a lot of the source to break it into multiple files and make it
        cleaner.
        --Added a menu to change the number of flows, renter the matrix, or go
        back to the real world. (Limiting FPS doesn't work yet)
        --Tried my hand at a Makefile. (It works on my eeepc but not in my
        coLinux with Debian)
        
    Version 2.1
        Fixed an off by one error that was causing pointers to point too far.
        
    Version 2.0
        Uses ncurses to print flows of random characters to a random initial
        column and animates the flows as if they were falling. There is also a 
        primitive FPS counter.
        
    Version 1.0
        Simply uses ncurses to print a random character to the next
        column of the terminal then loops back around when it reaches
        the end.
