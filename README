Curse The Matrix
Copyright (c) Justin Mancinelli

Obligatory matrix character flow written with ncurses.

The intention of this project is to help me learn C and get used to vim.

HISTORY
    Version 2.0
        Uses ncurses to print flows of random characters to a random initial
        column and animates the flows as if they were falling. There is also a 
        primitive FPS counter.
        
    Version 1.0
        Simply uses ncurses to print a random character to the next
        column of the terminal then loops back around when it reaches
        the end.
